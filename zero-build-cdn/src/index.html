    When you want to upgrade the versions of these libraries, find their latest releases at these places:

    React: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
    Babel: https://github.com/babel/babel/releases

    Use https://www.srihash.org to generate the integrity hashes.

    With the release of React 19, React no longer provides UMD builds. And unfortunately, React has also never published
    its libraries as ES modules either. This means that React isn't directly usable in a browser.

    We can work around this by pulling React from an "ESM-rewriting" CDN like JSPM, esm.sh, or others. These CDNs
    transform React CJS code into ESM code so that we can pull them into the browser via import maps. Import maps allow
    us to map bare module specifiers like "react" to CDN URLs.

    We are also using SRI (subresource integrity). The import map, including integrity hashes, were generated with
    JSPM Generator's online tool: https://generator.jspm.io . This is very useful because we don't have to figure out
    the whole dependency graph and compute the hashes ourselves.

    <!-- Use Babel to *load* (and transpile) JSX source code. We are using in-browser JSX (no build step)! This works
     because we have loaded the "babel/standalone" library and have specified the source type of "text/babel" in the
     script tag. The browser will key off the "text/babel" type and then hook into the Babel standalone component to
     transpile the JSX source code into browser compatible JS source code. Then, the browser will load and
     execute that JS source code. Pretty cool!

     The data-type="module" attribute tells Babel to preserve ES module syntax (import/export) instead of converting
     to CommonJS require statements.
