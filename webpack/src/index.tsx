// Reminder: it is normal in webpack-based projects to have unused imports in JavaScript files.
//
// Importing 'style.css' here is how we express "Hey webpack, I want style.css (CSS) on my web page (HTML)." The
// relationship of our CSS code to JavaScript code is not our choosing, but rather a consequence of webpack's design.
// It's an implementation detail that's exposed in the API.
//
// We don't actually author JavaScript code that makes use of this import, like we normally do with an import. Normally,
// we import a function, constant, or class from a JavaScript file and then invoke it or reference it in code. By
// contrast, the below import statement kicks off a circuitous software process that finds a way to load the CSS in our
// web page by way of JavaScript. You don't really need to know how it works, but you'll probably be curious.

const root: Element = document.createElement('div');
document.body.appendChild(root);
